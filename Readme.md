# Prediction products of chemical reaction 

Prediction the products of the reaction remains one of the most valuable task in computation chemistry. 
Now deep learning technique have made great success in the area. Moreover, a recent research shows that the task
can be solved with tools which  were developed for other areas. 

In the work I'll try to improve state of the art methods trying to combine DL architectures 
and different chemical features.
